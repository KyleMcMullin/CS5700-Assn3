# Info for keybinds and commands

Everything is bound to a custom keybind that does not require pushing ctrl. Each button that has an associated keybind has a tool tip indicating 
what the button does, and what key corresponds to it. The keybinds are not case sensitive.

Example: **Move Tool (m)**

Each of the tools has a keybind, as well as each of the pictures is associated with a number keybind.

# Special Command Instructions

The resize command uses the built in scale. Thus it is a "resize selected" command. You first user the Pointer Tool (p) to select the items, then
click the resize button (or click a) and it will resize selected items to the scale. 

The move command is similar, you can select as many items as you want, then move them to the point that you click whilst using the move tool (m).

The copy tool is the same, you select an item with the pointer and click copy or (c).
